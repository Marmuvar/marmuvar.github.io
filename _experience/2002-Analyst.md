As lead analyst, I conducted and developed testing protocols for novel drug products under developoment.  Working with pre-validated methods, I considered whether result deviations arose from sampling, testing, or actual product variance.  These key questions evolved as formulations and testing requirements changed more rapidly than methods could be completely validated.  These helped formulation scientists make key decisions about project milestones.  

Performed principal component analysis and partial least squares regression to determine potency of blend samples using a novel near infrared spectroscopy technique as part of a $1M expansion of analytical capabilities and improving analytical throughphut.  Method development required elements common to supervised learning techniques such as partial least square regression and cross validation.
