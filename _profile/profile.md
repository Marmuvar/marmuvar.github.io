I am a data scientist and analytical storyteller whose pharmaceutical engineering experience provides a balanced view among designing, questioning, and explaining data.  
As a scientist, I chose and performed experimental designs to develop new drug products.  Discussing necessary analytical tests and debating statistical versus practical result significance formed project cadence. As a technical lead for prototype and pilot-scale development projects, I collected, organized, and presented volumes of data to support complex controlled release formulations and other dosage forms.  Audiences ranged from technical peers to senior management and regulatory agencies.   

Now, I'm looking forward to exploring the data project questions that connect insights and stakeholders to better business outcomes.
